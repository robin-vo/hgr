Description: Implements a unified framework for claims reserving in non-life insurance,
    based on the insight that classical reserving methods are credibility estimators.
    Includes the Negative Binomial Chain-Ladder (NB-CL) model, Unified Credibility
    Reserving (UCR), Mack's distribution-free model, and classical Bühlmann-Straub
    credibility theory. UCR nests Chain-Ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, and Cape Cod
    as special cases with data-adaptive credibility weights. Provides functions for
    model fitting, prediction, variance estimation, parametric bootstrap, diagnostics,
    and model comparison.
